# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# stack.py -- Stack Dump Controller
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    The purpose of this file is to house the 'headless' components of the
#    stack dump window and its underlying functionality. This is split into
#    a model and controller component, of a typical 'MVC' design pattern.
#
#    The stack dump window abstracts from a simple hex dump. We use the code
#    below to configure our underlying hex dump to appear more like a typical
#    stack view might instead.
