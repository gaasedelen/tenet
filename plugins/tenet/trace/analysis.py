# analysis.py -- Trace Analysis
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    This file should contain logic to further process, augment, optimize or
#    annotate Tenet traces when a binary analysis framework such as IDA /
#    Binary Ninja is available to a trace reader.
#
#    As of now (v0.2) the only added analysis we do is to try and map
#    ASLR'd trace addresses to executable opened in the database.
#
#    In the future, I imagine this file will be used to indexing events
#    such as function calls, returns, entry and exit to unmapped regions,
#    service pointer annotations, and much more.
