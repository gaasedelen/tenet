#
#    The purpose of this file is to house the 'headless' components of the
#    memory dump window and its underlying functionality. This is split into
#    a model and controller component, of a typical 'MVC' design pattern.
#
#    As our memory dumps are largely abstracted off a generic 'hex dump',
#    there is very little code that actually has to be applied here (for now)
